# Simple ranges in R

A small number of compiled functions for handling ranges in R.

These functions primarily provide identification of sets of overlapping ranges
(regions or spans). To start with the functions will be limited to one-dimensional
ranges, but I may expand these to handle two dimensional regions.

This repository exists mainly, because I keep rewriting these functions in different
ways when I have a need for them. Similar functionality can be found from a number
of R packages, but these tend to add more complexity than I like.
